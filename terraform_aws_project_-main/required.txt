Thrilled to share that I've just completed a significant cloud project: deploying a highly available web 
application on AWS using Terraform. This project was an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited 
about the robust and scalable infrastructure weâ€™ve built.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:
1-Utilized an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across instances within an Auto Scaling 
Group (ASG), ensuring high availability and reliability.
2-Implemented a bastion host for secure SSH access to our infrastructure.
3-Configured S3 for seamless backup storage.
4-Designed secure network configurations using public and private subnets, and implemented a NAT gateway for 
secure outbound internet access from private instances.
